# A Pet Adoption App

_Production-ready application developed with Flutter, using BLoC as state management pattern. Moreover, its backend uses GraphQL and MongoDB_

## Motivation

Every year more than a thousand pets are sacrificed, only in Spain. Therefore, according to the diary 20minutos [3], the Fundacion Affinity’s director: Isabel Buil, remembered that adoption is “the best way to deal with abandonment short and long term”.

Another topic to be aware of is the increase of illegal animal trafficking, one of the main causes of abandonment. The reason for this is that currently there is not much control in the animal market in Spain.

Thus, this project aims to offer a platform to give more visibility to pets’ adoption. The final result will be an app where you will be able to contact to your closest shelters, buy animal related products, contract or offer services, put an animal for adoption, and more.
